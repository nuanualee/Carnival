Temasek Polytechnic's Policy on Plagiarism
Academic integrity is expected of all students at Temasek Polytechnic. The Polytechnic
requires all students to be assessed for their own work only. All students are required to give
proper acknowledgement of all original sources of work used in their assignments, projects or
other assessed work.

Disciplinary Action Against Students who Plagiarise
Plagiarism is a serious academic offence. Disciplinary action taken for students caught for
plagiarism will depend on the severity and includes failing the subject, suspension and removal
from course.

Definition of Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the act of taking and using the whole or any part of another person's work and
presenting it as your own without proper acknowledgement.
Examples of 'work' include text, writings, computer program, web page, on-line discussions,
video, music, sound recording, image, photograph, technical drawing, invention, research
findings, diagram, chart, artwork or design.
If you knowingly allow another student to use the whole or part of your work and to present it
as his or her own work, you could be liable for abetting plagiarism. The penalty for abetting
plagiarism includes failing the subject, suspension and removal from course.
